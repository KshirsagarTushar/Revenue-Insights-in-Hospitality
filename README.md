# Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze revenue data within the hospitality industry to uncover insights and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing revenue streams and enhancing overall profitability.

# Data Overview
The dataset used for this project consists of historical revenue data collected from various segments within the hospitality industry, across different zones in India. The data includes information on room bookings, booking platforms, capacity, ratings given, customer demographics, and other revenue-generating activities. The data is structured and consists of multiple tables, including bookings, transactions, customer demographics, and contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring preprocessing and cleaning before analysis. The dataset is sourced from reputable industry databases, proprietary company data, and publicly available datasets to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.

# Key Features
- **Data-driven Decision Making :**
Harness the power of data to make informed decisions. The Revenue Insights Dashboard consolidates and visualizes key revenue metrics, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand and act upon performance trends.

- **Hotel Performance Metrics :**
Tracks and analyzes critical performance indicators specific to the hospitality industry, such as room occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and more. Gains a holistic view of the factors influencing revenue generation.

- **Trend Analysis and Historical Comparison :**
Visualizes revenue trends over time and compares historical performance to identify growth opportunities and potential challenges. Leverages insights from past data to make strategic decisions for the future.

- **Goal Tracking and Performance Benchmarks :**
Set revenue targets and track performance against benchmarks. The dashboard provides a real-time view of progress toward goals, enabling proactive adjustments to strategies to meet or exceed revenue expectations.

# Methodology
**1. Defined Objectives and Requirements:**
Understood the business requirements.
Defined the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that need to be visualized. For e.g. RevPAR, DSRN, ADR, Occupancy %, Realisation % etc.

**2. Data Transformation and Cleaning:**
Cleansed and transformed the data using power query to ensure it's in a usable format.
Handled missing data, outliers, and other data quality issues.

**3. Data Modeling:**
Designed a data model that represents the relationships between different data tables.
Defined calculated columns and measures to derive new insights from the data. For e.g. wn, day_type etc.

**4. Implemented DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):**
Used DAX formulas to create advanced calculations and expressions for complex business logic. For e.g. RevPAR, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, Total Successful Bookings, Revenue Week on Week Change, RevPAR Week on Week Change, ADR Week on Week Change, DSRN Week on Week Change etc.
Leveraged DAX functions to perform aggregations, time intelligence, and other analytical tasks.

**5. Dashboard Creation:**
Created visualizations like charts, tables, and graphs to represent the data.
Chose appropriate visualization types based on the nature of the data and the insights that I wanted to convey.

# Key Metrics Tracked
- **Revenue :** Total revenue generated

- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Rooms) :** RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. 

- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) :** It means on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

- **Occupancy % :** Occupancy means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity).

- **ADR (Average Daily Rate) :** It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.

- **Realisation % :** It is nothing but the successful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened. It means on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

# Key Findings

3. Overall "Elite" room type has highest revenue generated where as "Standard" room type has the lowest.

4. Overall total revenue generation took pick in the month of May where as it brought down in the month of July.

5. Mumbai has highest value of RevPAR where as Hyderabad has the lowest one.

6. Overall "Presidential" room type has highest RevPAR where as "Standard" room type has the lowest.

7. Overall RevPAR took high in the month of May where as it went down in July.

8. Overall RevPAR is high on weekend than the weekday.

9. Delhi has highest occupancy % where as Bangalore has the lowest one.

10. Overall "Presidential" room type has highest occupancy % where as "Premium" room type has lowest.

11. Overall occupancy % took high in the month of May where as it went down in July.

12. Overall occupancy % is more on weekend(Friday, Saturday in Hospitality Industry) than the weekday.

13. Overall category "Luxury" has contribution of 61% in total revenue generation which is more than category "Business".
