 # REVENUE INSIGHTS - HOSPITALITY
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights. Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

# Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to analyze revenue data within the hospitality industry to uncover insights and provide actionable recommendations for optimizing revenue streams and enhancing overall profitability.

# Data Overview
The dataset used for this project consists of historical revenue data collected from various segments within the hospitality industry, specifically focusing on AtliQ Grands' five-star hotels across different zones in India. This comprehensive dataset includes information on room bookings, booking platforms, hotel capacity, customer ratings, customer demographics, and other revenue-generating activities.
The data is structured into multiple tables, such as bookings, transactions, and customer demographics. It contains both numerical and categorical variables, requiring preprocessing and cleaning before analysis to ensure accuracy and reliability.
To provide a holistic view and ensure comprehensive coverage, the dataset is sourced from reputable industry databases, proprietary company data from AtliQ Grands, and publicly available datasets. This diverse sourcing ensures that the data captures a wide range of factors influencing revenue and market share in the luxury/business hotel category.

# Key Features
- **Data-driven Decision Making :**
Harness the power of data to make informed decisions. The Revenue Insights Dashboard consolidates and visualizes key revenue metrics, allowing stakeholders to quickly understand and act upon performance trends.

- **Hotel Performance Metrics :**
Tracks and analyzes critical performance indicators specific to the hospitality industry, such as room occupancy rates, average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and more. Gains a holistic view of the factors influencing revenue generation.

- **Trend Analysis and Historical Comparison :**
Visualizes revenue trends over time and compares historical performance to identify growth opportunities and potential challenges. Leverages insights from past data to make strategic decisions for the future.

- **Goal Tracking and Performance Benchmarks :**
Set revenue targets and track performance against benchmarks. The dashboard provides a real-time view of progress toward goals, enabling proactive adjustments to strategies to meet or exceed revenue expectations.

# Methodology
**1. Defined Objectives and Requirements :**
Understood the business requirements.
Defined the key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that need to be visualized. For e.g. RevPAR, DSRN, ADR, Occupancy %, Realisation % etc.

**2. Data Transformation and Cleaning :**
Cleansed and transformed the data using power query to ensure it's in a usable format.
Handled missing data, outliers, and other data quality issues.

**3. Data Modeling :**
Designed a data model that represents the relationships between different data tables.
Defined calculated columns and measures to derive new insights from the data. For e.g. wn, day_type etc.

**4. Implemented DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) :**
Used DAX formulas to create advanced calculations and expressions for complex business logic. For e.g. RevPAR, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, Total Successful Bookings, Revenue Week on Week Change, RevPAR Week on Week Change, ADR Week on Week Change, DSRN Week on Week Change etc.
Leveraged DAX functions to perform aggregations, time intelligence, and other analytical tasks.

**5. Dashboard Creation :**
Created visualizations like charts, tables, and graphs to represent the data.
Chose appropriate visualization types based on the nature of the data and the insights that I wanted to convey.

# Key Metrics Tracked
- **Revenue :** Total revenue generated

- **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Rooms) :** RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. 

- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) :** It means on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

- **Occupancy % :** Occupancy means total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available(capacity).

- **ADR (Average Daily Rate) :** It is the ratio of revenue to the total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of the average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.

- **Realisation % :** It is nothing but the successful "checked out" percentage over all bookings happened. It means on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.
